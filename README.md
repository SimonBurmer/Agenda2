# Agenda20
The actual git repository is hosted by gitlab, thats why im just force pushing the latest Updates to this repo.

Agenda20 is a study project of my fourth semester at Munich University of Applied Sciences. Im using Java Springboot, Thymeleaf and Bootstrap to create an online course platform like https://www.skillshare.com/.
